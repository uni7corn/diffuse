### Hosting on your own server

Diffuse is a static web application, which means it's just HTML, CSS, and Javascript. No REST API, database, or anything backend-related involved. The app uses a hash (aka. fragment-based) routing system, so you don't need any special server rules for routing. You can download a pre-build web-only version of Diffuse on the [releases](https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse/releases) page. Diffuse uses service workers, so you may need HTTPS for it to work smoothly in certain browsers.

I should also note that some source services use OAuth, so you'll need to use your own application credentials (eg. Dropbox). That said, if you're working locally, you can use `http://localhost:8000` or `http://127.0.0.1:44999` to use the default ones, that's what the old Electron app was using.

In short:
- Diffuse is a static, serverless web application
- Routing is done using hashes/fragments (eg. `diffuse.sh/#/sources`)
- Download a web build on the [releases](https://github.com/icidasset/diffuse/releases) page
- Uses service workers (use HTTPS if possible)
- May need own OAuth application credentials for some source services
